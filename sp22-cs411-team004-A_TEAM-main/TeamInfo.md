## Project Summary

Our project title is "Rate My Game". We will implement a game rating website that allows users to create their accounts. Through this account, users will be able to rate and review games on the website, and the history of the reviews will be saved so that users can notice the difference between their reviews and the average game rating. The website will also recommend games of the same type to the user based on users' ratings. This is a feature that can be used to realize the commercial value of our project, for example, to promote new games. If people prefer not to create an account, the website will display the game's description, average rating, and reviews from other users. Besides, the site will cover filters and sorting features, which will allow people to look up games within a specific price/rating range or sort the games in ascending/descending order of ratings/price.
  
We intend to implement a user-friendly web page, through which users will be able to keep track of their favorite games, etc. The main thing is that we want to avoid the appearance of ads that are not related to the game. Similar sites place ads based on the user's browser browsing history; for example, if the user has recently searched for shoes, shoes' ads will appear on the pages even when browsing a game site. Our website will limit the categories of ads and only recommend games of the same type based on the user's preferences.
